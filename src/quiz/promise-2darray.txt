Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

The function sum2DArray is defined like a "fetch" and is asynchronous. It constructs a Promise object
and gives instructions for how to either resolve or reject the promise. If the input is not an array, the promise gets
rejected and handled by the corresponding catch block. If it is an array, the sum is calculated with
a timeout, which puts the calcualations in the event loop (timers phase). Once the main thread is finished 
we get the error result and finally then the sum output.

The promise itself runs on the main thread. Adding a "then" block takes the operation off of the main thread but not fully on to the event loop.
